A group of Vikings is exploring old dungeons. We know there are N chambers in total but weâ€™re not sure if all of them are reachable if we set out from the first chamber. We start from chamber no 1.
Instead of a map we have a description that looks like a code. We're interested in deciphering it and finding out if we're able to visit all the chambers.

Input:
From the first line of standard input, read single number N - total number of chambers (1<N<500).
Then read N lines with the connection available from each chamber (the first chamber, where we start from, has the number 1).
In every line of the input file there are one or two positive integer numbers separated by a single space denoting the indexes of chambers that are accessible from a given chamber.

Output:
The first and only line of output should show the number of chambers that are not reachable when starting from the first chamber (or print 0 if all chambers can be reached when starting from the first one).
